# Labs

I want to __explore different ways__ of doing/making things on the web. This site is a collection of web design experiments. They're like "Code Pens" that run on your own website.

I _encourage you_ to create your own design labs website. __Every web designer and front end web developer__ should create one. When you build your experiments, they'll work best if you focus on one thing.  Demonstrate how it might fit into a project. 

__Do use__:

* Web Standards - __HTML, CSS, JS__
* [Progressive Enhancement](http://www.sitepoint.com/progressive-enhancement-graceful-degradation-basics/)
* Accessibility and [WCAG 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)
* A subdomain of your website e.g. labs.example.com

__Please limit the use of__:
 
* SASS
* Frameworks - Rails, Laravel, Django, etc
* jQuery and other libraries

You don't want to become to reliant on libraries and frameworks. Use just
enough to serve the page to the browser.


These are design experiements to run in the browser. __Don't use__: 

* CMS - WordPress, Drupal, Joomla
* Databases
* JS Frameworks - Node, Backbone, React, Angular, Ember, etc 
* Grunt or Gulp
* Browser Plugins

Remember, the point is to push design, and the web, forward.

* __Avoid__ designing for a single browser e.g. "Best viewed in [browser
  name]"
* __Avoid__ relying on server side technology

As for things that aren't explicitly listed, but you are considering
using, ask yourself:

* Does it make the open web better?
* Will it lock someone in to a particular technology?

Other than that ... __go crazy. Push the limits!__
